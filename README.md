# rollup-wasm-pack-import (Rollup plugin)

This plugin allows you to use WebAssembly built with wasm-pack in rollup. (+ This also works with (service)workers)

## Requirements

 - A npm module (or external) built with wasm-pack. (**it has to be built with target ``web``**)
 - Rollup + config

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save-dev rollup-wasm-pack-import
```

## Usage

``rollup.config.js``
```js
import wasmImport from 'rollup-wasm-pack-import';

{
    plugins: [        
        wasmImport({            
            copy: true,
            mapping: {
                'my-wasm-module': 'my-wasm.wasm'
            }
        })
        ...
    ]
}
```

### Options:

Options object to configure wasm-pack-import.

Property      | Type     | Description
--------------|----------|------------
copy          | boolean  | if ``true``, the wasm will be copied in your output directory
mapping       | object   | ``key:`` module name of your wasm-pack npm module<br>``value:`` the web assembly file name
outputDir     | string   | if ``copy`` is set to true, the wasm files will be copied in this directory


### Your JS Code

Based on the current state of WebAssembly they need to be loaded async.

```js
// if its installed via npm
// if you are using a local directory built with wasm-pack, you can reference to '<relative-path>/pkg' (keep in mind to use the module name for options.mapping)
import * as wasm from 'my-wasm-module';

async function load() {
    // initialize the web assembly
    await wasm.default();
    console.log(wasm);
    // <your wasm code>
};
load();
```


## Hint
I wrote this plugin for my personal specific prototyp√≠ng use case. This means if you have slightly differnt requirements this plugin should be more like an inspiration which you can use and adapt. (currently there are no error check / tests its more like a poc)
